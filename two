Problem Title: Even Fiboncacci Numbers
Problem Statement: Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by 
adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms
 will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 
four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

while max(init) <= 4000000:   #stop generation of fib numbers at four million

    init.append(x)
    i += 1
